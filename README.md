# REST Tic Tac Toe exercise

This is the starting point for the REST Tic Tac Toe exercise.

The project is composed by two modules:
- [server](server/) - implementation of service
- [client](client/) - invocation of service

See the README for each module.
Start at the server and then go to the client.
